# Koikatsu: Become Trap / KK_BecomeTrap
Mod that adds a new setting to male character maker - "Character is a trap". Trap characters have following properties in main game:
- Different animations while in school
- Ability to freely enter changing rooms and toilets without the girls complaining or running away, and to talk with them as normal

The animation modifications are based on the upillusion0100-otokonoko mod.

### How to use
1. Make sure at least [BepInEx v4.1](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx), [BepisPlugins r7](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins) and [KKAPI v1.0](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKAPI) are installed, and your game is updated.
2. Download the latest release below.
3. Extract the archive directly into your game's directory (it has 2 folders, mods and BepInEx).
4. Start male character maker (can directly edit from class roster). You should see a new option right under the character name and blood type fields.
5. Start a new day in game. Idle and running animations should be changed.
- It's recommended to get the Nexus Trap Clothes zipmod for optimal trapping.
