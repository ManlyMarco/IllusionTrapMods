# Koikatsu: Become Trap / KK_BecomeTrap
Mod that adds a new setting to male character maker - "Character is a trap". Trap characters have following properties in main game:

- Ability to freely enter changing rooms and toilets without the girls complaining or running away, and to talk with them as normal

The animation modifications are based on the upillusion0100-otokonoko mod.

# AI-Shoujo Reverse Trap
This is a plugin for AI-Shoujo / AI-Girl / AI-Syoujyo that makes it possible to change animations of a female character to those of a male. This makes it look like some girls are actually guys when walking around.

The animations are changed in main game and in maker, not in studio. Animations are changed per-character, you can configure this in character maker in the Body > Overall tab.
